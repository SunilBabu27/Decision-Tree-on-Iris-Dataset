# Decision-Tree-on-Iris-Dataset
This segment of code deals with understanding how decision trees work using the Iris Dataset and try to build a model for decision tree, train the model and find the decision boundary.<br>
<br>1. First, load the Iris Dataset, which contains the data(data to learn), target(classification labels), target_names(meaning of the labels), feature_names(meaning of the features) and DESCR(full description of the dataset).<br>
<br>2. Once loaded, we explore the dataset to analyze its dimensionality, classes and features.<br>
<br>3. Then, plot the dataset using matplotlib to visualize the dataset.<br>
<br>4. Next, to understand the interaction of dimensions, we plot the first three PCA dimensions.<br>
<br>5. Now, create a DecisionTreeClassifier model, using the iris.data, iris.target and train the model.<br>
<br>6. Perform cross-validationto evaluate performance of the model.<br>
<br>7. Next, plot the decision surface of the decision tree using paired features.<br>
<br>8. Finally,optimize the decision tree and detect potential over-fitting.<br>
<br>9. Plot the final results.
